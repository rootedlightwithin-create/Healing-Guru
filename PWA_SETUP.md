# PWA Setup Instructions

## ✅ PWA Files Created

Your app is now a **Progressive Web App**! Users can install it on their phones/tablets.

## 📱 What You Need to Add

### App Icons (Required)
Create two PNG icons and save them in the `static/` folder:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

**Icon Design Tips:**
- Use your app logo/branding
- Simple, recognizable design
- High contrast colors
- No text (hard to read at small sizes)
- Square with rounded corners works best

**Free Icon Tools:**
- Canva (canva.com) - Use "Logo" template, export as PNG
- Figma (figma.com) - Free design tool
- Or use AI: "Create a purple gradient app icon with a lotus flower for a mental health app"

### Optional: Screenshot
- **screenshot.png** - 1080x1920 pixels (for app stores/listings)
- Take a screenshot of your app in action
